# Preparing Your Product<a name="PreparingYourProduct"></a>

 You prepare your product for publication on AWS Marketplace by configuring your package, setting a pricing scheme, determining what categories your product should show under, and adding keywords so your product appears in relevant searches\. 

 Your product can be an AMI\-based product, or a software as a service \(SaaS\) product\. Each has several options for packaging, pricing and delivery\. Some product types are not available to you as a seller on AWS Marketplace until you register for the program supporting that product type\.
