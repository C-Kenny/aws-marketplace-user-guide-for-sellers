# Submitting Your Listing for Publication<a name="product-submission"></a>

## <a name="w3aac15b3"></a>

 Product submission is the process used to make your products available to AWS Marketplace customers\. There are two tools used to submit products for publication in the AWS Marketplace\. The Self\-service Listing \(SSL\) tool is a menu\-driven tool available on the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/) \(AMMP\) you use to submit or edit product offerings\. The other tool is the Product Load Form, also available on the AMMP\. Use this table to determine whether you can submit your product using the SSL tool or will need to complete and submit the Product Load Form: 


|  **Pricing Model **Yes = product submission using SSL  No = product submission using Product Load Form   |  **Products launched using Single\-Node AMI **  |  **Products launched with AWS CloudFormation**  |  **Products launched as Software as a Service \(SaaS\)**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Bring Your Own License \(BYOL\)  |  Yes  |  No  |     | 
|  Free  |  Yes  |  No  |     | 
|  Hourly  |  Yes  |  No  |     | 
|  Hourly with Annual  |  Yes  |  No  |     | 
|  Monthly  |  No  |  No  |     | 
|  Hourly with Monthly  |  No  |  No  |     | 
|  Usage \(MMS\)  |  No  |  No  |     | 
|  SaaS Subscription  |     |     |  Yes  | 
|  SaaS Contract  |     |     |  Yes  | 
|  SaaS Legacy  |     |     |  No  | 

 You can submit products individually, or can submit multiple products at the same time\. Bulk submissions \(new products or updates to products\) cannot be completed using the SSL tool\. If you are unclear on what products can be submitted in what manner, we recommend you first try submitting your product using the SSL tool and only use the product load form if you cannot submit your products with SSL\. If you have any problems making your submissions, contact the AWS Marketplace Seller Operations team at aws\-marketplace\-seller\-ops@amazon\.com\. 

## Self\-Service Listings<a name="self-service-listings"></a>

 Self\-Service Listings is under the Listings tab of the AMMP\. To access Self\-Service Listings, log in to the AMMP and navigate to the [Listings tab](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/?)\. You can also track the status of your product listing requests, and view your request history\. Once you start a new product listing request, you can save your work in progress if necessary and create your listing in several different sessions\. 

 When you are ready to submit your product, your submission will be reviewed by the AWS Marketplace team\. You can monitor the status of your request on the Self\-Service Listings dashboard\. For new products, once your listing has been approved for publication, you will receive a Limited listing URL where you can preview and approve your submission prior to the listing going live\. Updates to your existing listings will be published directly to site\. This includes adding/removing versions, and metadata changes\. 

 Requests are listed in the SSL dashboard under **Requests**\. There are two tabs, **Open Requests** and **Request History**\. Your submissions will be listed as an open request until all processing of the request is complete\. For each request, the list will have the request date, product title, request type, request status, and action needed\. The status will be one of the following: 
+  **In Draft** – you have started the request process but have not submitted your request\. 
+  **Submitted** – you have completed and submitted your request and it is under review\. 
+  **Action Required** – AWS Marketplace has reviewed your request and needs additional information\. 
+  **Approval Required** – AWS Marketplace has created the limited listing page for your product and you must review and approve or reject the listing page before AWS Marketplace will publish\. If you approve, the status changes to **Publishing Pending** while the site gets published\. If you reject, the status returns to **In Draft** so you can modify the listing\. 
+  **Publishing Pending** – You have approved the mock\-up of your listing and AWS Marketplace is publishing your listing in AWS Marketplace\. 
+  **Expired** – You started the request process, but did not complete within six months so the request expired\. 

 Once all actions are completed for your listing, the request is moved to the **Request History** tab\. Requests will have a status or **Published** or **Cancelled**\. All published listings \(as a limited listing or a published product\) will appear under **Current Listings**\. On the Self\-Service Listings page, you can also view your current listings and download a pre\-filled product load form for each listing\. 

 If you have an entry with a status of **Submitted**, you can retract the submission\. If you have an entry with a status of **In Draft**, you can delete the request\. This will allow you to start over\. When you delete an **In Draft** entry, the entry is moved to the **Request History** tab\. 

 To list your product in the AWS GovCloud \(U\.S\.\) region, you need to [have an active AWS GovCloud \(U\.S\.\) account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/getting-started-sign-up.html) and comply with the AWS GovCloud \(U\.S\.\) requirements, including export control requirements\. 

### Submitting Products Using Self\-Service Listings<a name="submitting-products-using-self-service-listings"></a>

 You list most products using Self\-Service Listings\. To submit products using the SSL tool: 

1.  From the [AMMP](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/?), choose the **Listings** tab\. 

1.  In **Create a New Product**, use the pull\-down menu to select a pricing model, and then choose **Create Product**\. **Note**: monthly pricing is not supported in Self\-Service Listings\. For monthly pricing, use the Product Load Form\. 

1.  Fill out the metadata fields in each of the tabs and submit the information to be reviewed by the AWS Marketplace Seller Operations team\. Your product submission is reviewed for policy and security compliance, software vulnerabilities, and product usability prior to listing in AWS Marketplace\. Once you have submitted your new product you can monitor the status of your submission through the SSL dashboard\. When AWS Marketplace has approved your new listing’s metadata submission, you will be provided with a link to review a limited version of your new product listing through the Self\-Service Listings portal\. After you review and approve your limited listing, your product listing will be published to the AWS Marketplace website and the limited listing removed\. 

### Updating Products Using Self\-Service Listings<a name="updating-products-using-self-service-listings"></a>

 The SSL tool is used to make one or more changes to the listings you created with the SSL tool\. You can add a new version, remove existing versions, and update pricing, instance types, region availability, and metadata\. To make an update, you prepare any updated product the same way you do new products\. Once the product is prepared: 

1.  From the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/?), choose the **Listings** tab\. 

1.  In **Current Listings**, locate the product you want to modify\. 

1.  Under the **Actions** column \(for the product you want to edit\), use the **Select action** pull\-down menu to choose the change you want to make\. 

1.  Fill out the appropriate fields in each of the tabs and submit your change\. 

 Your product submission is reviewed using a similar process to the one used when you create a new product\. You can monitor the status of your submission using the SSL dashboard\. After your product has been approved by the AWS Marketplace team your updates will be published live on the AWS Marketplace web site\. 

## Company and Product Logo Requirements<a name="seller-and-product-logos"></a>

 Your company logo and the logo for the products you list through AWS Marketplace need to conform to our guidelines so that the user experience is uniform when browsing AWS Marketplace\. 

 **Product Logo Specifications** – Your product logo image should have a transparent or white background and be 120 to 640 pixels in size, with a 1:1 or 2:1 \(wide\) ratio\. 

 **Company Logo Specifications** – Your company logo image should have a transparent background and be 220 x 220 pixels in size, allowing for 10 pixels of padding on each side within\. 

## AWS CloudFormation\-launched Product \(free or paid\) or Usage\-based paid AMI product<a name="aws-cloudformation-launched-product-free-or-paid-or-usage-based-paid-ami-product"></a>

 Products that AWS Marketplace customer launch by using AWS CloudFormation templates must be submitted using the **Product Load Form** available through the AMMP\. 

### Submitting Your Product<a name="submitting-your-product"></a>

1.  From the [AMMP](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/?), download the Product Load Form for your product\. 

1.  Add your product definition, which includes product information \(title, description, highlights\), technical information \(AMI\_ID, regions, instance types, OS\), and pricing details \(pricing model, Free Trial\)\. 

1.  Submit your form following the instructions under the Instructions table of the spreadsheet\. 

 AWS Marketplace reviews your product for policy and security compliance, software vulnerabilities, and product usability\. If there are any questions or issues with a request, the AWS Marketplace team will contact you via email to discuss your request\. Once approved, a mock\-up of your listing page will be created\. You review the listing and accept or reject the listing\. Once approved, the listing will be added to the AWS Marketplace\. 

### Updating Your Product<a name="updating-your-product"></a>

 The Product Load Form is used to make one or more changes to the listings you created using the Product Load Form\. You can make changes to the original product load form you completed, or, if not available you can start with a new load form\. Just like using the SSL tool, you can add a new version, remove existing versions, and update pricing, instance types, region availability, and metadata\. To make an update, you prepare any updated product the same way you do new products\. Once the product is prepared: 

1.  Use your existing product load form, or, from the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/?), download the [Product Load Form](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-loadforms/ProductDataLoad-Current.xlsx)\. 

1.  Update your product submission in the product load form\. 

1.  From the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/?), Choose **File Upload**\. 

1.  On the **File Uploads** page, upload your updated product load form and AWS CloudFormation templates\. The file uploader provides a secure transfer mechanism and a history of submitted files\. The uploader automatically notifies the AWS Marketplace team to begin processing your request\. Include a description of the submission \(adding new version, changing price, changing metadata, etc\.\)\. 

 Your product submission is reviewed for policy and security compliance, software vulnerabilities, and product usability\. If there are any questions or issues with a request, the AWS Marketplace team will contact you via email\. You do not review the updated listing prior to release to the AWS Marketplace\. Updates to existing listings are processed and released directly to the AWS Marketplace\. 

## Product Changes and Updates<a name="product-changes-and-updates"></a>

 Sellers can submit changes to their product at any time, and they will be processed as described above\. However, some changes can only be made every 90 or 120 days, or when pending changes are in place\. Examples include price changes, and region/instance type changes\. Common changes include: 
+  **New Version \-** New versions of the software, roll\-outs of patches or updates\. At your request, we can notify customers who have subscribed to Your Marketplace Content about the availability of new versions or send upgrade instructions on your behalf\. 
+  **Metadata change** \- Changes to product information \(Description, URLs, and Usage Instructions\)\. 
+  **Pricing Change** \- A change to the pricing amount\. A notification to current customers is sent once the request is complete\. 
+  **Pricing Model Change** \- A change to the pricing model \(i\.e\. Hourly, Free, Hourly\_Annual\)\. Not all pricing model changes are supported and all requests to change models must be reviewed and approved by AWS Marketplace\. **Note**: Any change from a free to a paid model presents significant impact to existing customers\. An alternative is to propose a new listing with additional features and encourage current customers to migrate\. 
+  **Region or Instance change** \- Adding or removing instances types or regions\. 
+  **Product takedown \-** Remove a listing from AWS Marketplace to prevent new customers from subscribing\. A notification to current customers is sent once the request is complete\. 

## Timing and Expectations<a name="timing-and-expectations"></a>

 While we strive to process requests as quickly as possible, requests can require multiple iterations and review by the seller and AWS Marketplace teams\. Use the following as guidance for how long it will take to complete the process: 
+  Total request time normally takes **2\-4 weeks of calendar time;** more complex requests or products can add additional time to allow for multiple iterations and adjustments to product metadata and software\. 
+  Review and processing of requests typically requires **3 business days**\. We will notify you if there are any issues that require additional action\. 
+  We request a completed Product Form or Self\-Service Listings request and AMI at least **45 days in advance** of any planned events or releases so we can prioritize the request accordingly\. 

 If you have any questions about your request, contact AWS Marketplace Seller Operations at **aws\-marketplace\-seller\-ops@amazon\.com**\. 

## Submitting AMIs to AWS Marketplace<a name="submitting-amis-to-aws-marketplace"></a>

 **ALL** AMIs built and submitted to AWS Marketplace must adhere to all product policies\. We suggest a few final checks of your AMI prior to submission: 
+  Remove all user credentials from the system; all default passwords, auth keys, key pairs, security keys or other credentials\. 
+  Ensure that root login is disabled / locked; only sudo access accounts are allowed\. 
+  If you are submitting an AMI to be deployed into the AWS GovCloud \(US\) region, you need to [have an active AWS GovCloud account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/getting-started-sign-up.html) and agree to the [AWS GovCloud Requirements](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/), including applicable export control requirements\. 

### AMI Self Service Scanning<a name="ami-self-service-scanning"></a>

 Self\-service AMI scanning is available within the AWS Marketplace Management Portal\. With this feature, you can initiate scans of your AMIs and receive scanning results quickly – typically in less than an hour – with clear feedback in a single location\. 

 **To begin sharing and scanning your AMI with this new service:** 

1.  Navigate to [https://aws\.amazon\.com/marketplace/management/manage\-products/](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/manage-products/) 

1.  Select the AMI to share 

1.  View your scan results 

 Once your AMI has successfully been scanned, you can follow the current process to submit the AMI for processing by the AWS Marketplace Seller and Catalog Operations team by [uploading](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/product-load/) your product load form or emailing **aws\-marketplace\-seller\-ops@amazon\.com**\. 

 Please note that in order for your AMI to be included in the self\-service AMI scanning list, it must be in the us\-east\-1 \(N\. Virginia\) region and owned by your AWS Marketplace seller account\. If you need additional accounts whitelisted for the AWS Marketplace Management Portal, please contact **aws\-marketplace\-seller\-ops@amazon\.com** with the AWS Account ID that owns the AMI to be scanned\. 

### AMI Cloning and Product Code Assignment<a name="ami-cloning-and-product-code-assignment"></a>

 Once your AMI is submitted, AWS Marketplace will create cloned AMIs for each region that you have indicated that software should be available\. During this cloning and publishing process, AWS Marketplace will attach a product code to the cloned AMIs\. The product code is used to both control access and to meter usage\. All submissions must go through this AMI cloning process\.
