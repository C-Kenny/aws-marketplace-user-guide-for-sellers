 The [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/) is your primary tool\. These other tools and reports can give you more insight into your customer base and help you better understand your sales\. 

## AWS Marketplace Commerce Analytics Service<a name="commerce-analytics-intro"></a>

 The AWS Marketplace Commerce Analytics Service makes it possible for you to programmatically access product and customer data through AWS Marketplace\. The data is delivered as data sets\. Most of the data sets provide the same data as the text\-based reports you can access through the AWS Marketplace Management Portal\. 

## AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing Program<a name="enhanced-data-sharing-intro"></a>

 The AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing Program provides you with more buyer information, such as buyer email domain, AWS account ID, and location, on a daily and monthly basis\. This data can help you correctly map deals and opportunities to the appropriate sales representative by company, geography, and account ID\. 

## AWS Marketplace Field Demonstration Program<a name="field-demonstration-program"></a>

The AWS Marketplace Field Demonstration Program \(FDP\) allows internally approved AWS employees to use some Independent Software Vendor \(ISV\) solutions through AWS Marketplace at no charge\. Examples of approved AWS employees may include solution architects, and sales and marketing professionals\. The FDP allows these employees to demonstrate product capabilities for education and potential inclusion in customer workloads\.

The FDP includes only products that ISVs contractually agreed to make available at no charge to the AWS field team for educational and demonstration purposes\. The following product types are supported:
+ [Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\)](ami-products.md) 
+ [Containers](container-based-products.md) 
+ [Machine learning algorithms and model packages \(Amazon SageMaker\)](machine-learning-products.md) 
+ [Data sets \(AWS Data Exchange\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/what-is.html)

As an ISV, you're automatically enrolled in this program when you sign up as an AWS Marketplace seller\. To opt out, submit a support request to the [Managed Catalog Operations \(MCO\) team](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/)\.

To view information about product usage under this program, see the [AWS field demonstration usage](monthly-billed-revenue-report.md#section-3-aws-field-demonstration-usage) section of the [Monthly billed revenue report](monthly-billed-revenue-report.md)\.

**Note**  
Currently, data products don't support this feature\.
