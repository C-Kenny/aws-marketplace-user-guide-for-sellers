For more information, see [AWS Marketplace Go\-to\-Market Program Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-loadforms/AWS_MP_GTM_ProgramGuide.pdf) and [AWS Marketplace Go\-to\-Market Best Practices Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-loadforms/GTM_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf)\. 

## Announcing Your Product's Availability<a name="AnnouncingYourProductsAvailability"></a>

 We encourage you to broadly announce the availability of your product on AWS Marketplace\. You can do this via press releases, tweets, blogs, or any other preferred media channels\. We have provided sample text that you can to include, along with guidelines and instructions for using our trademarks and issuing press releases\. 

 We will review your blogs, tweets, and other non\-press release announcements before going public to ensure consistency with AWS messaging and brand guidelines or voice\. Submit your request for review to your account manager AWS\. The review takes up to 10 business days to complete\. Notify us when you post any tweets, blogs, or press releases, and we will do our best to repost to increase their visibility\. 

## AWS Marketplace Messaging<a name="AWSMarketplaceMessaging"></a>

 In your customer communications you might want to describe the purpose, goals, and benefits of purchasing your product using AWS Marketplace\. Use the following messaging when referring to AWS Marketplace\. 

 **What is AWS Marketplace?** 

 AWS Marketplace is an online store that makes it easy for customers to find, compare, and immediately start using the software and services that run on AWS\. Visitors to AWS Marketplace can use AWS Marketplace’s 1\-Click deployment to quickly launch pre\-configured software and pay only for what they use, by the hour or month\. AWS handles billing and payments, and software charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\. 

 **Why would a customer shop on AWS Marketplace?** 

 Finding and deploying software can be challenging\. AWS Marketplace features a wide selection of commercial and free IT and business software, including software infrastructure such as databases and application servers, developer tools, and business applications, from popular sellers\. AWS Marketplace enables customers to compare options, read reviews, and quickly find the software that they want\. Then they can deploy it to their own Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance using 1\-Click or using the AWS Marketplace Management Portal\. 

 Software prices are clearly posted on the website and customers can purchase most software immediately, with payment instruments already on file with Amazon Web Services\. Software charges appear on the same monthly bill as AWS infrastructure charges\. 

 **Why would software or SaaS providers sell on AWS Marketplace?** 

 With AWS Marketplace, software and software as a service \(SaaS\) providers with offerings that run on AWS can benefit from increased customer awareness, simplified deployment, and automated billing\. 

 AWS Marketplace helps software and SaaS providers that sell software and services that run on AWS find new customers by exposing their products to some of the hundreds of thousands of AWS customers, ranging from individual software developers to large enterprises\. 

 Selling on AWS Marketplace enables independent software vendors \(ISVs\) to add hourly billing for their software without undertaking costly code changes\. They simply upload an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) to AWS and provide the hourly cost\. Billing is managed by AWS Marketplace, relieving sellers of the responsibility of metering usage, managing customer accounts, and processing payments, leaving software developers more time to focus on building great software\. 

 Additionally, customers benefit from the ability to easily deploy preconfigured images of the software simplifying onboarding for new customers\. 

## Linking to AWS Marketplace<a name="linking-to-aws-marketplace"></a>

 Your company likely has a web presence where it describes and promotes your product\. We encourage you to highlight that the product is available to run on AWS and can be purchased using AWS Marketplace\. To simplify the process for your customers to discover and deploy your software, we have provided instructions for linking your customers to your product\. 

## Using the AWS Marketplace Logo<a name="using-the-aws-marketplace-logo"></a>

 The AWS Marketplace logo is a way to easily tell your customers that your software runs on AWS and is available in AWS Marketplace\. If you would like to promote your software in AWS Marketplace, [download the archived folder \(\.zip file\)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-logos/AWS_Marketplace-Logos-AllFormats-171006.zip), which contains multiple color treatments and file formats here\. 

## Linking Directly to Your Product on AWS Marketplace<a name="linking-directly-to-your-product-on-aws-marketplace"></a>

 You can send your customers directly to the product’s information page on AWS Marketplace by including deep links on your website or collateral\. Use the following example link structure for browser\-based linking\.

```
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/ASIN
```

 Replace ASIN segment of the URL with your product’s ASIN\. 

**Example**  

```
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00635Y2IW
```

 The ASIN appears in the URL when you search for your application on [aws\.amazon\.com/marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/)\. Alternatively, you can consult with your account manager to find the ASIN\. 

**Note**  
 Test the links before using them to make sure that they direct your customers to the correct page\. 

## Press Releases<a name="press-releases"></a>

 We encourage you to announce your product’s availability on AWS Marketplace through any channel you prefer\. However, all press releases that reference AWS Marketplace must be reviewed and signed off on by Amazon before any publication or announcement is made\. While we encourage you to make announcements, we can't support joint press releases with AWS Marketplace sellers\. We will, on a case\-by\-case basis, support press releases with a quote from AWS\. The quote must meet several conditions, including but not limited to: it announces a new product or service listed on AWS Marketplace or that it includes a customer reference that uses AWS Marketplace\. 

 All press releases must be drafted by you\. We suggest the following headline: \[Insert product name\] Now Available on AWS Marketplace\. Use the messaging in this document for consistency\. 

 The press release **should**: 
+  Clearly and accurately describe how the announcement relates to Amazon\.com 
+  Clarify your role on AWS and with customers 
+  Be customer\-focused and emphasize the customer benefit 

 The press release **should not**: 
+  Use the terms *partners*, *partnership*, or *alliance* to describe the relationship\. We prefer *agreement*, *teamed*, or *relationship*\. 
+  Include a quote from an Amazon Web Services executive unless previously agreed upon\.
+  Include any sales projections or use \.com by the merchant unless referring to the web site in your company boilerplate\.
+  Refer to your organization as an associate of Amazon\.com because this could be confused with Amazon Associates, our online affiliate program\.
+  Disclose proprietary information about Amazon\.com or refer to our stock ticker symbol\. 

 Have your press release reviewed by submitting it in text format to your account manager\. Additionally, review the [Amazon Web Services trademark guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/trademark-guidelines/) before using any AWS trademarks\. Guidelines specific to the AWS Marketplace trademark are in the following section\.
