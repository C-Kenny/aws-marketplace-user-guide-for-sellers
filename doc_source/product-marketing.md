# Marketing Your Product<a name="product-marketing"></a>

 You can contribute to your products’ success by driving awareness of AWS Marketplace and by driving traffic directly to the pages on AWS Marketplace where your products are listed for sale\. The purpose of this document is to provide the information and support to help you market the product you have listed on AWS Marketplace\. Additional information is available in the [AWS Marketplace Go\-to\-Market Program Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-loadforms/AWS_MP_GTM_ProgramGuide.pdf) and the [AWS Marketplace Go\-to\-Market Best Practices Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-loadforms/GTM_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf)\. 

## Announcing Your Product's Availability<a name="AnnouncingYourProductsAvailability"></a>

 We encourage you to broadly announce the availability of your product on AWS Marketplace\. You may do this via press releases, tweets, blogs, or any other channel you prefer\. We’ve provided sample text that you may wish to include, along with guidelines and instructions for using our trademarks and issuing press releases\. 

 We are happy to review your blogs, tweets and other non\-press release announcements prior to going public to ensure consistency with AWS messaging and brand guidelines or voice\. Please provide AWS with 10 business days’ notice to review and submit to your account manager\. Please notify upon posting of any tweets, blogs, and press releases and we will do our best to re\-post and increase their visibility\. 

## AWS Marketplace Messaging<a name="AWSMarketplaceMessaging"></a>

 In your communications to customers, you may wish to describe the purpose, goals, and benefits of AWS Marketplace\. Please see below for standard messaging for AWS Marketplace\. 

 **What is AWS Marketplace?** 

 AWS Marketplace is an online store that makes it easy for customers to find, compare, and immediately start using the software and services that run on AWS that they need to build products and run their businesses\. Visitors to AWS Marketplace can use AWS Marketplace’s 1\-Click deployment to quickly launch pre\-configured software and pay only for what they use, by the hour or month\. AWS handles billing and payments, and software charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\. 

 **Why would a customer shop on AWS Marketplace?** 

 Finding and deploying software can be challenging\. AWS Marketplace features a wide selection of commercial and free IT and business software, including software infrastructure such as databases and application servers, developer tools, and business applications, from popular sellers\. AWS Marketplace enables customers to compare options, read reviews, and quickly find the software they want\. Once found, they can deploy that software to their own EC2 instance using 1\-Click or using the AWS Marketplace Management Console\. 

 Software prices are clearly posted on the website and customers can purchase most software immediately, with payment instruments already on file with Amazon Web Services\. Software charges appear on the same monthly bill as AWS infrastructure charges\. 

 **Why would software or SaaS providers sell on AWS Marketplace?** 

 With AWS Marketplace, software and Software as a Service \(SaaS\) providers with offerings that run on AWS can benefit from increased customer awareness, simplified deployment, and automated billing\. 

 AWS Marketplace helps software and SaaS providers that sell software and services that run on AWS find new customers by exposing their products to some of the hundreds of thousands of AWS customers, ranging from individual software developers to large enterprises\. 

 Selling on AWS Marketplace allows ISVs to add hourly billing for their software, without undertaking costly code changes\. They simply upload an Amazon Machine Image to AWS and provide the hourly cost\. Billing is managed by AWS Marketplace, relieving sellers of the responsibility of metering usage, managing customer accounts, and processing payments, leaving software developers more time to focus on building great software\. 

 Additionally, customers will benefit from the ability to easily deploy preconfigured images of the software simplifying onboarding for new customers\. 

## Linking to AWS Marketplace<a name="linking-to-aws-marketplace"></a>

 Your company likely has a web presence where it describes and promotes your product\. We encourage you to highlight the fact that the product is available to run on AWS and can be purchased on AWS Marketplace\. To simplify the process for your customers to discover and deploy your software, we have provided instructions for linking your customers to your product\. 

## Using the AWS Marketplace Logo<a name="using-the-aws-marketplace-logo"></a>

 The **AWS Marketplace** logo is a way to easily tell your customers that your software runs on AWS and is available in AWS Marketplace\. If you would like to promote your software in AWS Marketplace, [download the archived folder \(\.zip file\)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-logos/AWS_Marketplace-Logos-AllFormats-171006.zip) which contains multple color treatments and file formats here\. 

## Linking Directly to Your Product on AWS Marketplace<a name="linking-directly-to-your-product-on-aws-marketplace"></a>

 You can send your customers directly to the product’s information page on AWS Marketplace by including deep links on your website or collateral\. For web\-browser based linking, please use this example link structure: 

 http://aws\.amazon\.com/marketplace/pp/ASIN/ref=vdr\_rf 

 Replace ASIN segment of the URL with your product’s ASIN\. 

 **Example**: 

 [https://aws\.amazon\.com/marketplace/pp/B00635Y2IW/ref=\_ptnr\_vdr\_rf](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00635Y2IW/ref=_ptnr_vdr_rf) 

 You will find the ASIN in the URL when you search for your application on aws\.amazon\.com/marketplace\. Alternatively, you can consult with your account manager to find the ASIN\. 

 **Note**: Please test the links before using them to make sure that they direct to the correct page\. 

## Press Releases<a name="press-releases"></a>

 As noted above, we encourage you to announce your product’s availability on AWS Marketplace through any channel you prefer; however, all press releases that reference AWS Marketplace must be reviewed and signed off by Amazon before any publication or announcement is made\. While we encourage you to make announcements, we cannot support joint press releases with AWS Marketplace sellers\. We will on a per case review basis support press releases with a quote from AWS if it meets several conditions including but not limited to: it announces a new product or service listed on AWS Marketplace or that it includes a customer reference that uses AWS Marketplace\. 

 All press releases must be drafted by you\. We suggest the following headline: \[Insert product name\] Now Available on AWS Marketplace\. Please use the messaging in this document for consistency\. 

 The press release **should**: 
+  Clearly and accurately describe how the announcement relates to Amazon\.com 
+  Clarify your role on AWS and with customers 
+  Be customer\-focused and emphasize a customer benefit\(s\) 

 The press release **should not**: 
+  Use the terms 'partners' or 'partnership' or 'alliance' to describe the relationship\. We prefer 'agreement', 'teamed', or 'relationship'\. 
+  Include a quote from an Amazon Web Services executive unless previously agreed upon 
+  Include any sales projections; use '\.com' by the merchant unless referring to the web site in your company boilerplate 
+  Refer to your organization as an 'associate' of Amazon\.com, as this could be confused with Amazon Associates, our online affiliate program 
+  Disclose proprietary information about Amazon\.com, or refer to our stock ticker symbol\. Please submit your press release draft in text format to your account manager\.
