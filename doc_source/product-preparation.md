# Preparing Your Product<a name="product-preparation"></a>

 You prepare your product for publication on AWS Marketplace by configuring your package, setting a pricing scheme, determining what categories your product should show under, and adding keywords so your product appears in relevant searches\. 

 Your product can be an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)\-based product, or a software as a service \(SaaS\)\-based product\. 
+ AMI\-based products can be offered as single AMIs, AMI\-based products delivered to customers using AWS CloudFormation templates, and multiple AMIs delivered using one or multiple AWS CloudFormation templates\. You can offer AMI\-based products with pay\-as\-you\-go, hourly, monthly, and annual pricing\.
+ SaaS\-based products are sold and billed through AWS Marketplace, but customers access your product through your environment\. SaaS products can be offered with subscription\-based or contract\-based pricing models\. With subscription\-based offerings, you send metering data to AWS Marketplace and AWS adds the charges to the AWS Marketplace customer's AWS bill\. With contract\-based products, AWS Marketplace customers agree to a contract and pay for contract up front\. 

**Note**  
For more information about publishing and managing data products and offers through AWS Data Exchange, see [Providing Data Products on AWS Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/providing-data-sets.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.

 Each has several options for packaging, pricing and delivery\. Some product types are not available to you as a seller on AWS Marketplace until you register for the program supporting that product type\. 
+ You can create products with a standard list price and end user license agreement \(EULA\), and can create private offers for individual customers with custom pricing and EULAs\. If you need additional changes to the terms of the contract, you can work with the AWS Marketplace team to create a custom private offer\. 
+ You can also sign up for AWS Marketplace Private Images, which is available through a public beta that AWS Marketplace is hosting\. Using this packaging option you can offer your products to AWS Marketplace customers in a way that allows them to install your product on a base *gold image* that meets their internal standards for operating system configuration\. With AWS Marketplace Private Images, you provide AWS Marketplace an installable version of your software\. AWS Marketplace customers use AWS Marketplace to purchase and install your software on their base image\. The resulting AMI is added to their account as an AMI available through their Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud console\.
