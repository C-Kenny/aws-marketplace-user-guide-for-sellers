# Preparing your product<a name="product-preparation"></a>

You prepare your product for publication on AWS Marketplace by configuring your package, setting a pricing scheme, determining what categories your product should show under, and adding keywords so your product appears in relevant searches\. 

Your product can be an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)\-based product, or a software as a service \(SaaS\)\-based product: 
+ AMI\-based products can be offered as single AMIs, AMI\-based products delivered to customers using AWS CloudFormation templates, and multiple AMIs delivered using one or multiple AWS CloudFormation templates\. You can offer AMI\-based products with pay\-as\-you\-go, hourly, monthly, and annual pricing\.
+ SaaS\-based products are sold and billed through AWS Marketplace, but customers access your product through your environment\. SaaS products can be offered with subscription\-based or contract\-based pricing models\. With subscription\-based offerings, you send metering data to AWS Marketplace and AWS adds the charges to the AWS Marketplace customer's AWS bill\. With contract\-based products, AWS Marketplace customers agree to a contract and pay for contract up front\. 

Both AMI\-based products and SaaS\-based products provide several options for packaging, pricing and delivery\. Some product types are not available to you as a seller on AWS Marketplace until you register for the program supporting that product type\. Options include the following:
+ You can create products with a standard list price and end user license agreement \(EULA\)\. 
+ You can create private offers for individual customers with custom pricing and EULAs\. If you need to make additional changes to the terms of the contract, you can work with the AWS Marketplace team to create a custom private offer\. 
**Tip**  
To simplify the procurement process, you can use [standardized license terms](standardized-license-terms.md) for both public product listings and private offers\.
+ You can sign up for AWS Marketplace private images\. For more information, see [Private images](private-images.md)\.
