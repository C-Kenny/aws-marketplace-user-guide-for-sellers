# What is AWS Marketplace?<a name="what-is-marketplace"></a>

 AWS Marketplace is an online store that helps customers find, buy, and immediately start using the software and services they need to build products and run their businesses\. AWS Marketplace complements programs like the Amazon Partner Network and is another example of AWS’s commitment to growing a strong ecosystem of software and solution partners\. 

 Visitors to the marketplace can use AWS Marketplace’s 1\-Click deployment to quickly launch pre\-configured software and pay only for what they use, by the hour or month\. AWS handles billing and payments, and software charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\.

## How Can I Use AWS Marketplace?<a name="how-to-use-marketplace"></a>

You use AWS Marketplace primarily as a subscriber \(buyer\), or as a seller\.

### Using AWS Marketplace as a Subscriber<a name="using-marketplace-subscriber"></a>

 AWS Marketplace is an online store where, as a subscriber, you can find, buy, and quickly deploy software that runs on Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)\. This software is available in the form of Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\)\. An Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) contains all the information necessary to boot an Amazon EC2 instance with your software\. An EC2 instance is the virtual computing environment available from the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) web service\. 

 An AMI is like a template of a computer's root volume\. For example, an AMI might contain the software to act as a web server \(Linux, Apache, and your web site\) or it might contain the software to act as a Hadoop node \(Linux, Hadoop, and a custom application\)\. You can launch one or more EC2 instances from an AMI\. 

 To buy software through AWS Marketplace, you subscribe to the software by purchasing a paid AMI, and then launch the software as an EC2 instance\.
