# What Is AWS Marketplace?<a name="what-is-marketplace"></a>

 AWS Marketplace is an online store that helps customers find, buy, and immediately start using the software and services they need to build products and run their businesses\. AWS Marketplace complements programs like the Amazon Partner Network and is another example of AWS’s commitment to growing a strong ecosystem of software and solution partners\. 

 Visitors to the marketplace can use AWS Marketplace’s 1\-Click deployment to quickly launch pre\-configured software and pay only for what they use, by the hour or month\. AWS handles billing and payments, and software charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\.

## How Can I Use AWS Marketplace?<a name="how-to-use-marketplace"></a>

You use AWS Marketplace primarily as a subscriber \(buyer\), or as a seller\.

### Using AWS Marketplace as a Subscriber<a name="using-marketplace-subscriber"></a>

 AWS Marketplace is an online store where, as a subscriber, you can find, buy, and quickly deploy software that runs on Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)\. This software is available in the form of Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\)\. An Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) contains all the information necessary to boot an Amazon EC2 instance with your software\. An EC2 instance is the virtual computing environment available from the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) web service\. 

 An AMI is like a template of a computer's root volume\. For example, an AMI might contain the software to act as a web server \(Linux, Apache, and your web site\) or it might contain the software to act as a Hadoop node \(Linux, Hadoop, and a custom application\)\. You can launch one or more EC2 instances from an AMI\. 

 To buy software through AWS Marketplace, you subscribe to the software by purchasing a paid AMI, and then launch the software as an EC2 instance\.

### Using AWS Marketplace as a Seller<a name="using-marketplace-seller"></a>

As a seller, you can build a custom AMI to sell on AWS Marketplace and manage the sales channel for products you sell\. For information about becoming a seller on AWS Marketplace, go to the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/)\. For detailed information about selling your AMI, see [Selling Your AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/paid-amis.html#selling-your-ami) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. 

To manage the sales channel for products you sell on AWS Marketplace, you use the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com//marketplace/management/tour/), where you can access five different pages from the navigation bar links: 
+ **Marketing Tab**

  Use this page to view the results of your marketing efforts and to better understand the traffic, conversion, customer usage, and revenue that your marketing efforts generate\.
+ **Support Tab**

  Your support staff can use this page to access near\-real\-time information about a customer's subscription to your products and provide fast, personalized service\.

  Use this page to download all your latest reports, including Weekly Ref Tag Reports and other product subscription and usage reports\.

  Use this page to share your AMI with AWS Marketplace and have your AMI scanned to ensure it meets the listing requirements\. You can also view all your AMIs \(whether shared or unshared\), and download data for your existing published products\.
+ **Image Build Tab**

  On this page, you can create a new AMI for your product listing, or enable one or more Private Image fulfillment options for customers by creating an installable software "package group"\. A package group is a set of one or more executable binaries or scripts that will install your software product on a supported base image\.

  Use this page to upload files to AWS Marketplace, including product metadata, images, and product documentation\.
