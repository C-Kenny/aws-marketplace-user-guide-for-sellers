# Categories and Metadata<a name="categories-and-metadata"></a>

 Here are best practices, tips and notes on supplying product metadata\. AWS Marketplace will make revisions to the product metadata provided solely for quality assurance and error correction\. 

## Naming and Describing Your Product<a name="naming-and-describing-your-product"></a>

 The information about your product becomes the face of the product to customers\. As you decide on your product name, description, highlights, and so on, consider using information that is both compelling and differentiates your software from other software\. 

 The information you provide is important to ensure that potential customers have enough information to make informed acquisition and buying decisions\. 

### Optimizing the Product Name Field<a name="optimizing-the-product-name-field"></a>

 Keep the following guidelines in mind as you create the product name\. 
+  Use title case \(first letter of each word is capitalized\) 
+  Ensure that a customer can identify the product by the name alone 
+  Use the name of the brand or manufacturer 
+  Do not include descriptive data or hyperbole 

 **Example**: Smart Solution Load Balancer \- Premium Edition 

### Writing the Product Description<a name="writing-the-product-description"></a>

 The product description lists the product's features, benefits, usage, and provides other relevant and specific product information\. The description can be up to 350 characters long\. A customer might read the description if they are interested enough to learn more about the product than is obvious from the name or highlights\. 

 Keep the following guidelines in mind as you create the product description\. 
+  Avoid unnecessary capitalization 
+  Avoid unnecessary punctuation marks 
+  Do not include redirect information 
+  Check spelling and grammar 
+  Include only critical, useful information 

 **Example**: Smart Solution automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances\. It enables you to achieve even greater fault tolerance in your applications, seamlessly providing the amount of load balancing capacity needed in response to incoming application traffic\. Smart Solution detects unhealthy instances within a pool and automatically reroutes traffic to healthy instances until the unhealthy instances have been restored\. Customers can enable Smart Solution within a single AWS availability zone or across multiple zones to ensure more consistent application performance\. 

### Writing the Product Highlights<a name="writing-the-product-highlights"></a>

 The product information page displays up to three product highlight bullet points\. The descriptive text you write for each highlight should describe the product’s primary selling points in brief, informative, and easy\-to\-understand language\. 

 **Example**: Projecting Costs \- With Smart Solution, you only pay for what you use\. You are charged for each hour or partial hour your Smart Solution is running\. 

### Writing the Release Notes<a name="writing-the-release-notes"></a>

 Each time you update an AMI product, you must provide a description of the changes in release notes\. Your release notes should contain specific information to help the user decide whether to install the update\. Use clear labels for the update, such as “Critical” for a security update or “Important” or “Optional” for other types of updates\. 

### Writing the Usage Instructions<a name="writing-the-usage-instructions"></a>

 The usage instructions are critical to ensure that each user is able to successfully configure and run the software\. This field will display during the AMI configuration process so the usage instructions must contain all information the user will need\. Failure to provide clear instructions could result in unnecessary support contacts\. 
+  Usage instructions should be written with a new or moderately technical person in mind and not necessarily an IT Manager or Engineer\. It is also best not to assume the user has prior experience with or extensive knowledge of the product, or computer operating systems\. 
+  Usage should take the customer from 1\-click launch all the way to using the product, including any configuration or special steps to get the application running\. 

 **Example**: 

1.  Launch the product via 1\-click\. 

1.  Access the application via web browser at https://<EC2\_Instance\_Public\_DNS>/index\.html\. 

1.  Login using the username “user” and the instance\_id of the instance as the password\. 

## Choosing Categories and Keywords<a name="choosing-categories-and-keywords"></a>

 When you list your product, you can choose up to three software categories and corresponding subcategories for your product\. This helps customers discover your product as they browse or search the listings on AWS Marketplace\. Please choose only categories that are relevant to your product\. In most cases, only one category will apply\. The **[Product Load Form](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-loadforms/ProductDataLoad-Current.xlsx) and Self\-Service Listings portal both** contain a complete list of categories\. 

 **Note**: Categories are not the same as keywords\. The categories and subcategories available are predefined for AWS Marketplace and you decide which categories and subcategories apply to your product by selecting these from a list during the listing process\. Keywords are not predefined, but are created during the listing process\. You do not need to add the category as a keyword\. 

### Creating Search Keywords<a name="creating-search-keywords"></a>

 During the product listing process, you can enter up to three keywords \(single words or phrases\) to help customers discover your product through site searches\. The field for the keywords can contain a **maximum of 50 characters**\. 

 The following tips can help you to create a relevant set of search keywords\. 
+  Use terms that are relevant so that customers can easily find your products 
+  Choose keywords from your customer’s vocabulary—that is, choose words and phrases that customers are likely to use when thinking about your type of product 
+  Create keywords based on specific features in your product 
+  The product title is already indexed in our search; the terms you submit should not contain the title of your product 

 **Note**: Keywords are not the same as software categories\. Keywords are more specific terms that are related to your product\.
