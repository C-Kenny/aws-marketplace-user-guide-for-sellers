# Getting Started as a Seller<a name="user-guide-for-sellers"></a>

 If you want to sell your software on AWS Marketplace, review the requirements and then follow the steps to register as a seller\. There are different registration requirements based on where you reside and what type of products you're selling\. To register as a seller on AWS Marketplace, you can use an existing AWS account or create a new account\. All AWS Marketplace interactions are tied to the account that you choose\. 

**Note**  
Registering as an AWS Marketplace seller is a prerequisite to be an AWS Data Exchange data provider\. For more information on these requirements, see [Providing Data Products on AWS Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/providing-data-sets.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.

## Seller Requirements for Publishing Free Software Products on AWS Marketplace<a name="seller-requirements-for-publishing-free-products"></a>

 Whether you charge for your product or not, when you offer it on AWS Marketplace, you're selling that product\. The cost to the customer is $0\.00, but you and the customer agree to a mutual contract for use of the product\. If you offer only free products, you don't have to provide banking information to AWS Marketplace\. To create and offer free products on AWS Marketplace, you must: 
+  Sell publicly available, full\-feature production\-ready software 
+  Have a defined customer support process and support organization 
+  Provide a means to keep software regularly updated and free of vulnerabilities 
+  Follow best practices and guidelines when marketing your product on AWS Marketplace 
+  Be an AWS customer in good standing and meet the requirements in the terms and conditions for AWS Marketplace sellers 

## Additional Seller Requirements<a name="additional-seller-requirements-for-paid-products"></a>

If you charge for your products, offer bring\-your\-own\-license model \(BYOL\) products, or want to register as an AWS Data Exchange data provider, you must also meet the following requirements and provide this additional information:
+  You must be a permanent US or European Union \(EU\) resident or citizen, or a business entity organized or incorporated in the United States or member state of the EU\. 
+  You must provide tax and bank account information\. For US\-based entities, a W\-9 form and a banking account from a US\-based bank are required\. 
+  European Union state members are required to provide a W\-8 form, value added tax \(VAT\) number, and US bank account\. If you don't have a US bank account, you can register for a virtual US bank account from [Hyperwallet](https://wssellers.hyperwallet.com/)\. 
+ To provide data products, you must also request on\-boarding through the [Create case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/cases?#/create?issueType=customer-service) wizard for AWS Support\.

 To sell into the AWS GovCloud \(US\) Region, sellers must have an [AWS GovCloud \(US\) account](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/getting-started/)\. For details on ITAR requirements, see the *[AWS GovCloud \(US\) User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/getting-started-sign-up.html)*\. 

 For questions about AWS Marketplace seller requirements or the registration process, contact the [AWS Marketplace Seller Operations](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/) team\. 

## AWS Marketplace Management Portal<a name="management-portal"></a>

 The [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour) is the tool that you use to register as an AWS Marketplace seller and then to manage the products that you sell on AWS Marketplace\. You can complete the following tasks on the portal:
+  Register as an AWS Marketplace seller 
+  Use the **Products** page to submit new software products and update existing software products 
+  Monitor the status of your requests 
+  Upload files needed to create and manage your new software products 
+  Manage your software products into incremental channel revenue by taking advantage of the go\-to\-market activities 
+  Measure the results of your marketing efforts within hours of launch, including the usage and revenue driven by your campaigns 
+  Customer service representatives can retrieve customer data in real time 
+  Initiate an automatic AMI scan to detect vulnerabilities 

**Note**  
Data products are published and managed from the AWS Data Exchange console\. AWS Data Exchange providers can use the AWS Marketplace Management Portal to register as a seller, request AWS Data Exchange on\-boarding, access seller reports, and submit refund requests\.

 All registered sellers can access the AWS Marketplace Management Portal using their AWS credentials for the account that they used to create their products\. The account that you use is defined as the seller of record when a customer subscribes to your product\. If you need help determining the specific account that is the seller of record for your products, contact the [AWS Marketplace Seller Operations](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/) team\. 

 AWS Marketplace strongly recommends using IAM roles to sign in to the AWS Marketplace Management Portal rather than using your root account credentials\. For more information, see [IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_identity-management.html#intro-identity-users) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

 To enable people in your company to sign in to the AWS Marketplace Management Portal, create an IAM user for each person you want to have access and define access permissions to the AWS Marketplace Management Portal\. We also recommend creating a *root* or account owner IAM to use for access\.
