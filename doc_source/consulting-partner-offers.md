# Consulting Partner Private Offers<a name="consulting-partner-offers"></a>

AWS Marketplace consulting partner private offers \(CPPO\) enable you, as a consulting partner, to resell independent software vendors' \(ISVs\) product on AWS Marketplace\. First, you put an agreement in place with an ISV to resell one or more of their products\. Next, you extend a private offer to your customer for that product\.

CPPO gives benefits for every party involved with the offer\. You benefit because you own and maintain the financial and contractual relationship with your customers\. The ISV benefits because they can better support their channel relationships by providing a channel resale capability through AWS Marketplace\. The customer benefits because they get to purchase the product that they want from the company that they want, combining their software purchases with the relationships and expertise of consulting partners\.

CPPO\-enabled resales are an extension of the private offers managed through the [AWS Marketplace Seller Private Offers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/private-offers.html) program\. Private offers are visible only to a single customer, with customized pricing and unique commercial terms to meet that customer's needs\. There are two types of private offers that you can create:
+ Recurring discount private offers
+ Non\-recurring discount private offers

With recurring discount private offers, an ISV authorizes you to resell their product or products at an agreed\-to discount from their list price\. The discount is expressed as a percentage off the list price\. With non\-recurring discount private offers, the discount that the ISV gives you can be used only with a specific customer and only once\. In both cases, after the customer pays for the private offer, AWS Marketplace uses the standard process to distribute the funds to you and to the ISV based on the agreed\-to percentages\.

**Important**  
To participate in a CPPO resale, you must be registered through the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management) as an AWS Marketplace seller\.

## Putting an Agreement in Place with an ISV<a name="consulting-partner-isv-agreement"></a>

You and the ISV complete and sign your portions of the AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization form and return the form to AWS Marketplace\. Email the form to mpcustdesk@amazon\.com or to your AWS Marketplace channel account manager\. The form includes the following information:
+ The product or products that you can resell
+ The percentage \(%\) reduction off the prices listed on AWS Marketplace
+ The AWS account ID that you used to register as an AWS Marketplace seller

After AWS receives the completed and signed form, you're an authorized reseller for that product\.

## Offering a Recurring Discount Private Offer<a name="consulting-partner-recurring-discount"></a>

For recurring discount private offers, an ISV authorizes you to resell one or more of their products on AWS Marketplace\. The discount is an agreed\-to percentage discount off the product’s list price\. You can use the discount with any or as many customers as you want, so it's like a wholesale price to you\.

When you're ready to extend a private offer \(typically after all negotiations are completed and the customer has agreed to final price and terms\), complete, sign, and email the AWS Marketplace Custom Transaction Request form \(provided by AWS Marketplace\) to mpcustdesk@amazon\.com or to your AWS Marketplace channel account manager\. This form includes information about the transaction including the following:
+ The customer's account ID
+ The product being sold
+ The price that you're setting for the private offer
+ Any custom terms

For certain scenarios, both you and your customer are required to sign the form before sending it to AWS Marketplace\. For example, when a private offer includes a multi\-year transaction with scheduled payment amounts, you and your customer must sign the form\. If you have any questions, contact AWS Marketplace\.

## Offering a Non\-Recurring Discount Private Offer<a name="consulting-partner-non-recurring-discount"></a>

An ISV can extend a one\-time wholesale price to you for the purpose of a specific resale to a designated buyer\. This discount, expressed as a percentage off the list price, becomes the wholesale price to you for a specific transaction to a uniquely identified customer\.

The ISV can extend a one\-time wholesale price to you by completing and signing the AWS Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction form, provided by AWS Marketplace\. You agree to the terms by signing the same form\. The form includes the following:
+ The product\(s\) on AWS Marketplace that you can resell privately\.
+ The wholesale cost as determined by the ISV\. The cost is expressed as a percentage \(%\) reduction off the list price on AWS Marketplace\.
+ The account ID that you used to register as an AWS Marketplace seller\.
+ The customer’s name and account ID\.

Either you or the ISV emails the signed authorization form, along with any other agreed\-upon terms specific to the resale relationship on AWS Marketplace\. Email the form to mpcustdesk@amazon\.com or to your AWS Marketplace channel account manager\.

## What Happens After You Submit Your Form?<a name="consulting-partner-after-submitting-form"></a>

After you submit your recurring discount private offer or non\-recurring discount private offer, the offer and any disbursement of funds occur in the same manner:

1. After AWS Marketplace receives the AWS Marketplace Custom Transaction Request form, we create a custom private offer for the customer on your behalf\. For more information on offer discovery and subscription for your customer, see [Experience for the Buyer of a Seller Private Offer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/private-offers.html#experience-for-the-buyer-of-a-seller-private-offer)\.

1. AWS Marketplace invoices the customer on their existing AWS bill per the terms of the private offer\. If the private offer is extended to a linked account, the invoiced amount appears on the payer account associated with that linked account\.

1. The customer pays their AWS bill in accordance with the net payment terms that they agreed to with AWS\. The private offer process enables custom terms for each transaction, but net payment terms aren't customizable\. 

1. After AWS receives payment from the customer, AWS disburses payment to you and the ISV\. The ISV receives the wholesale cost minus the AWS Marketplace fee\. You receive your markup minus the AWS Marketplace processing fee\. All fees are percentages applied to the transaction amounts listed\. If you're not sure of the fee percentages and need this information for quoting purposes, contact your AWS Marketplace channel account manager\. If you don’t know who that is, email the AWS Marketplace channel team at aws\-mp\-channel@amazon\.com, and someone on the team will respond to you within 24 hours\. 

1. AWS Marketplace provides electronic reports to the ISV and to you using the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management)\. These reports have the following differences depending on the type of private offer:
   + For recurring discount private offers, the ISV sees you as the buyer and you see the customer as the buyer
   + For non\-recurring discount private offers, you and the ISV see the customer as the buyer

For more information on AWS Marketplace reporting, see [Seller Reporting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/Reporting.html)\.
