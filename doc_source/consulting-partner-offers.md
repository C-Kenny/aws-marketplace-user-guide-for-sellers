# Consulting Partner Private Offers<a name="consulting-partner-offers"></a>

AWS Marketplace consulting partner private offers allow consulting partners to resell independent software vendors' \(ISVs\) product on AWS Marketplace\. The consulting partner puts an agreement in place with an ISV to resell one or more of their products, and then they extend a private offer to your subscriber for that product\.

Each consulting partner private offer is visible only to a single subscriber, with customized pricing and unique commercial terms to meet that subscriber's needs\. When creating a private offer, When reselling on AWS Marketplace, you start from a wholesale cost set by the ISV which you then mark up to create the subscriber's offer price\. The wholesale cost is determined in one of two ways:
+ **Recurring discount** – An ISV authorizes the consulting partner to resell their product or products at an agreed\-to discount from their list price\. The discount is expressed as a percentage off the list price\. This discount allows the consulting partner to continue to resell the product without further price negotiation with the ISV\.
+ **Non\-recurring opportunity discount** – The discount that the ISV gives you is intended to be used only with a specific subscriber\. 

In both cases, after the subscriber pays for the private offer, AWS Marketplace uses the standard process to distribute the funds to the consulting partner and the ISV based on the agreed\-to percentages\.
