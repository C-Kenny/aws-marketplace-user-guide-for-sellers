# Consulting Partner Private Offers<a name="consulting-partner-offers"></a>

AWS Marketplace Consulting Partner Private Offers enables you to resell independent software vendors' \(ISVs'\) products\. Your customers purchase software from you, their trusted consulting partner, directly through AWS Marketplace\. The customer benefits from your knowledge of their business, localized support, and expertise\. Independent software vendors \(ISVs\) authorize you to resell their products in AWS Marketplace\. This enables you to own and maintain the financial and contractual relationship with your customers\. You can create an offer with Seller Private Offers  visible only to your customer, with customized pricing and unique commercial terms to meet your customer's needs\.

The following describes how you can become an authorized reseller and resell products to your customers\.

1.  Register as an AWS Marketplace seller to enable you to be listed as the seller of record for the transaction\. To register, visit [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/)\(AMMP\) and choose **Sign Up as an AWS Marketplace Seller**\. Complete the registration process, including the banking and tax wizards\. 

1.  Provide your AWS account ID to the ISV whose product you want to resell\. The ISV extends an invitation to resell to the AWS account ID that you used to register as an AWS Marketplace seller\. The invitation includes the wholesale price for each product, and is expressed as a percentage \(%\) reduction off of the publicly available price in AWS Marketplace\. The ISV can add additional contractual terms on a product\-by\-product basis\. The AWS Marketplace business development team can assist with this process\. 

1.  You can accept the invitation to resell or let the invitation expire\. After you accept the offer, you can resell the specified product or products using [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/)\. You can extend an offer with Seller Private Offers to your customers for any of the products you are authorized to resell\. 

The following work flow describes how you can create a private offer\.

1.  You set the pricing for your offer\. The pricing is expressed as a percentage markup on the wholesale cost\. 

1. Once you extend the private offer, your customer can subscribe to the product\. After they subscribe, your customer sees the product as manufactured by the ISV, but with you as the seller of record\.

1.  AWS Marketplace invoices your customer for the subscription on your customer’s AWS consolidated bill\. 

1.  After your customer pays AWS Marketplace for the subscription, AWS Marketplace disburses the proceeds to you and the ISV\. 

 AWS Marketplace enhanced reporting provides additional details for offers that follow this process\. For the ISV, you're listed as the buyer\. This helps the ISV see the activity and gauge the effectiveness of their channel\. For you, the amount received from the customer is listed as gross revenue, and the amount cost to the ISV and AWS Marketplace processing fee are listed\. 

## Non\-Recurring Discounts<a name="non-recurring-discounts"></a>
