# Machine Learning Products<a name="machine-learning-products"></a>

 AWS Marketplace enables sellers to create machine learning \(ML\) algorithms and models in Amazon SageMaker and list them in AWS Marketplace\. Sellers can package their products as Docker containers, upload them to [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) \(Amazon ECR\), create the algorithm or model packages in Amazon SageMaker, and list them as products in AWS Marketplace\. 

 In AWS Marketplace, sellers provide a product description, pricing, usage instructions, sample notebooks, and support information\. AWS customers can find these products through the Amazon SageMaker console or AWS Marketplace, and deploy them to Amazon SageMaker\. Sellers can list free trial and paid products in the AWS Marketplace\.

## Amazon SageMaker Algorithms and Model Packages<a name="amazon-sagemaker-algorithms-and-model-packages"></a>

 As a seller of Amazon SageMaker products, you can list an algorithm, a model package, or both\.  

**Amazon SageMaker algorithm**  
 An Amazon SageMaker algorithm enables the buyer to perform end\-to\-end machine learning\. It has two logical components: training and inference\. Buyers use the training component to create a training job in Amazon SageMaker and build an ML model\. Amazon SageMaker saves the model artifacts generated by the algorithm during training to the buyer's [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) \(Amazon S3\) bucket\.   
 Buyers use the algorithm’s inference component together with the model artifacts to build a model package\. They use the model package to run real\-time or batch transform jobs in Amazon SageMaker\. As a seller, you can charge buyers for training and inference separately\.  

**Amazon SageMaker model package**  
 Model packages contain a pretrained model, and buyers can run real\-time or batch inference jobs in Amazon SageMaker\. They use the model for hosting services or batch transforms in Amazon SageMaker\. A model package contains an inference component that is packaged along with model artifacts that you provide\. As a seller, you can build your model artifacts by training with Amazon SageMaker or you can use your own model artifacts from a previously built model\. You can charge buyers for the inference jobs\.
