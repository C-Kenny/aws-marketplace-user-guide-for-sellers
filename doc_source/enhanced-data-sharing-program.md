# AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing Program<a name="enhanced-data-sharing-program"></a>

 The AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing \(EDS\) program focuses on delivering *enhanced* buyer information, such as buyer email domain, AWS account ID, and location, on a daily and monthly basis to select AWS Marketplace sellers\. The goal of delivering buyer information is to provide a framework for sellers to compensate their sales teams for AWS Marketplace subscription revenue\. Sharing monthly billed revenue information, usage information, and disbursed funds information by buyer provides a mechanism to help you correctly map deals and opportunities to the appropriate sales representative by company, geography, and AWS account ID\.

## EDS Program FAQs<a name="eds-program-faqs"></a>

 **By participating in the EDS program, will I receive an identifiable corporate email domain for every customer?** 

 Not necessarily\. The Sales Compensation Report that you receive will contain the email domain that the customer shared with AWS\. In some cases, this domain may be a generic email domain associated with a personal email address, as opposed to an identifiable corporate email domain\. 

 **Does the Sales Compensation Report contain billed revenue or disbursed revenue?** 

 The Sales Compensation Report contains buyer information with monthly billed revenue 

 **I prefer to compensate my field based on disbursed revenue, not billed revenue\. How can I map the Sales Compensation Report to my disbursed revenue?** 

 AWSMP issues a Disbursement Report each month for every seller with paid products; this report covers all disbursed revenue for the month and is available through both [AWS Marketplace Management Portal \(AMMP\)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/reports/) and via the [AWS Marketplace Commerce Analytics Service \(CAS\) API](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/cas/enroll)\. By participating in EDS, you will also receive additional customer data columns \(email domain, location, and AWS account ID\) directly in your monthly Disbursement Report\. 

 **I prefer to compensate my field based on daily usage data\. How can I do this?** 

 As an EDS participant, you will automatically receive additional customer data columns, including email domain, location, and AWS Account ID, in your Daily Business Report, which is published every 24 hours and is available through both AMMP and the CAS API\. 

 **How does the timing of the Sales Compensation Report relate to the timing of the Disbursement Report that I receive from AWSMP?** 

 The Sales Compensation Report is available in AMMP and via the CAS API on the fifteenth day of each month\. Disbursement Reports are typically published between the tenth and thirteenth of each month\. For questions regarding your specific Disbursement Report delivery schedule, contact the [https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/) team\. 

 **How does the timing of the Sales Compensation Report relate to the timing of the Monthly Billed Revenue Report that I receive from AWSMP?** 

 The Sales Compensation Report and Monthly Billed Revenue Report are both published on the fifteenth day of each month and contain information regarding monthly billed revenue\. The Monthly Billed Revenue Report does not include identifiable customer data; line items from these two reports can be cross\-referenced using the Transaction Reference ID\.
